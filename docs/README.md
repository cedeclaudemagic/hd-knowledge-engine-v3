# Documentation Overview

This directory contains two main article series and supporting reference materials exploring Human Design through an electromagnetic lens.

## Quick Navigation

### Article Series

**[Electromagnetic Consciousness Series](./articles/electromagnetic-consciousness-series/)** (Published Sep 2025)
Individual consciousness as electromagnetic phenomenon — from the monopole as transformer through to transpersonal forms.

1. [The Transformer at the Heart of Being](./articles/electromagnetic-consciousness-series/01-transformer-at-heart-of-being.md) — Why consciousness requires AC, not DC
2. [The Circuit Speaks](./articles/electromagnetic-consciousness-series/02-circuit-speaks.md) — Reading Human Design as electromagnetic architecture
3. [The Vortex and the Wave](./articles/electromagnetic-consciousness-series/03-vortex-and-wave.md) — When human fields form electromagnetic hierarchies (Penta/Wa intro)
4. [The Nine Resonators](./articles/electromagnetic-consciousness-series/04-nine-resonators.md) — Centres as quantum-to-classical electromagnetic architecture
5. [Inside the Vortex](./articles/electromagnetic-consciousness-series/05-inside-the-vortex.md) — The Penta as electromagnetic circuit *(unpublished draft)*

**[The Wheel Series](./articles/wheel-series/)** (In Development)
The mathematical structure of the Rave Mandala — nested frequencies, trigrams, and the electromagnetic cycle.

1. [The Breathing Wheel](./articles/wheel-series/01-breathing-wheel.md) — Nested frequencies and the hub-rim structure
2. [The Three Readings](./articles/wheel-series/02-three-readings.md) — Binary, bigram, and trigram as lenses
3. [The Electromagnetic Cycle](./articles/wheel-series/03-electromagnetic-cycle.md) — Eight trigram states as phases of accumulation and expression
4. The Chemistry of Form *(planned)* — Aromatic amino acid distribution and the seed/manifestation inversion

The **EM Consciousness Series** moves from individual architecture (transformer, circuit, centres) outward to transpersonal forms (Penta, Wa).

The **Wheel Series** examines the mandala's mathematical structure — the same trigram cycle that appears in article 3 of each series, providing a bridge point.
