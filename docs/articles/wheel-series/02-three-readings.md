# The Three Readings

*Second in a series exploring the mathematical structure of the Rave Mandala*

*Status: DRAFT — not yet published*

---

The wheel breathes. We established that.

Six lines, six frequencies. The bottom barely moves. The top flickers constantly. Every position is a chord of six notes sounding together.

But there's more structure here. The lines don't just stack — they group. And each grouping reveals something different about where you're standing.

---

## Reading One: The Binary

This is the foundation. The smallest unit. One line. Yang or yin.

Yang: solid, unbroken. Charge. Movement. The impulse to express.

Yin: broken, open. Void. Stillness. The space that receives.

Every line in every hexagram is one or the other. That's it. On or off. Pulse or rest.

But here's what's easy to miss: yang only means something *in relation to* yin. They define each other. There's no charge without void to move into. No void without charge to receive.

This is the fundamental polarity. Not good and bad. Not high and low. Just... the two phases of a single breath.

Inhale. Exhale.
Charge. Discharge.
Yang. Yin.

## Reading Two: The Bigram

Now we pair two lines together.

There are three bigrams in every hexagram:
- Lines 1-2 (bottom pair)
- Lines 3-4 (middle pair)
- Lines 5-6 (top pair)

Each pair can be one of four combinations:

| Bigram | Pattern | Quality |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 00 | yin-yin | Maximum receptivity |
| 01 | yin-yang | Rising |
| 10 | yang-yin | Descending |
| 11 | yang-yang | Maximum expression |

And here's where something extraordinary emerges.

## The Four Domains

Ra taught that the bottom bigram — Lines 1 and 2 — defines which *Quarter* of the wheel you're in.

| Bigram | Quarter | Domain |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 00 | Civilisation | Form |
| 11 | Mutation | Spirit |
| 10 | Initiation | Mind |
| 01 | Duality | Relationship |

Remember what we found: Lines 1 and 2 each change only twice around the wheel, creating the four quadrants through their offset hemispheres.

This is why. The bottom bigram IS the Quarter. The most stable part of the hexagram — the slowest frequency — defines the fundamental domain you're operating in.

Form or Spirit. Mind or Relationship.

And notice the oppositions:
- 00 (Form) is opposite to 11 (Spirit)
- 01 (Relationship) is opposite to 10 (Mind)

Every bit flipped. Maximum polarity. The Quarter you're standing in is defined by its relationship to the Quarter across the wheel.

---

## The Three Territories

The three bigrams also map to different territories of experience:

**Lines 1-2 (Bottom Bigram):** The foundation. Form. Body. The tribal ground. What persists.

**Lines 3-4 (Middle Bigram):** The individual. Relationship. The bridge between inner and outer. What connects.

**Lines 5-6 (Top Bigram):** The collective. Mind. The transpersonal field. What radiates.

We saw this in the breathing pattern. The bottom is stable — tribal, foundational, slow to change. The top is volatile — collective, mental, constantly shifting.

The bigram reading shows us *which territory* each pair is operating in, and *what mode* (00, 01, 10, or 11) it's expressing.

## Reading Three: The Trigram

Now we take three lines together.

The lower trigram: Lines 1, 2, 3.
The upper trigram: Lines 4, 5, 6.

Three binaries create eight possible patterns. Here they are in cycle order — the sequence they follow around the wheel:

| Trigram | Binary | Name |
|---------|--------|------|
| ☷ | 000 | Earth |
| ☶ | 001 | Mountain |
| ☵ | 010 | Water |
| ☴ | 011 | Wind |
| ☰ | 111 | Heaven |
| ☱ | 110 | Lake |
| ☲ | 101 | Fire |
| ☳ | 100 | Thunder |

These aren't just names. They're *states*. Phases. Modes of being that the energy moves through.

---

## The Eight States

Feel into them, following the cycle:

**Earth (000)** — Pure yin. The ground that receives everything. Stable. Still. Where form is held. The deepest rest.

**Mountain (001)** — Yin foundation with yang emerging at the top. Stillness below, something stirring above. Containing. Storing. Not yet moving but pregnant with potential.

**Water (010)** — Yang in the middle, flowing between yin banks. Current. The path of least resistance. Moving through, not staying.

**Wind (011)** — Yang building on a yin foundation. Gradual. Persistent. Accumulating. The gentle pressure that never stops.

**Heaven (111)** — Pure yang. Maximum charge. Full. Nowhere left to accumulate. The moment before discharge becomes inevitable.

**Lake (110)** — Yang foundation with yin opening at the top. The mouth. The surface that breaks. Ready to release what's been contained.

**Fire (101)** — Yang on both sides, yin in the middle. Holding emptiness within radiance. Light. Illumination. The sustained glow.

**Thunder (100)** — Yang bursting from yin. The spark. The impulse. Discharge. The moment of release.

---

## The Pairs Across the Wheel

Each trigram has its opposite — every bit inverted:

| Pair | Polarity |
|------|----------|
| Heaven (111) ↔ Earth (000) | Maximum charge ↔ Maximum ground |
| Lake (110) ↔ Mountain (001) | Opening ↔ Containing |
| Fire (101) ↔ Water (010) | Radiating ↔ Flowing |
| Thunder (100) ↔ Wind (011) | Discharging ↔ Accumulating |

These pairs need each other. Heaven seeks Earth to discharge into. Earth receives what Heaven releases. Thunder is the sudden spark that Wind has been building toward. Fire radiates what Water carries.

The wheel is structured so that opposites face each other across the mandala. This isn't decoration. It's the architecture of attraction itself.

## The Hexagram as Chord

Now we can read any hexagram through all three lenses:

**Gate 2 (000000)**
- Binary: All yin. Every line receptive. Maximum stillness.
- Bigram: Bottom 00 (Form), Middle 00 (Form), Top 00 (Form). Form all the way through.
- Trigram: Earth below, Earth above. Ground upon ground.
- And across the wheel: Gate 1 (111111). Its perfect opposite. Heaven over Heaven. Maximum attraction.

**Gate 41 (110001)**
- Binary: Yang-yang-yin-yin-yin-yang. Charge at foundation, void in the middle, yang emerging at top.
- Bigram: Bottom 11 (Spirit), Middle 00 (Form), Top 01 (Relationship).
- Trigram: Lake below (110), Mountain above (001). Opening beneath stillness. (I Ching: "Mountain over Lake")
- Lower trigram (Lake) seeks Mountain. Upper trigram (Mountain) seeks Lake. Each seeks its opposite.

Every gate is a specific chord. A unique combination of pulse, domain, and state.

---

## Why This Matters

These aren't intellectual exercises. They're ways of *feeling* where you are.

The binary tells you: what's the quality of this moment? Charge or rest?

The bigram tells you: what domain? Form, Spirit, Mind, or Relationship? And what mode — building, releasing, receiving, expressing?

The trigram tells you: what state? Where in the great cycle? And what's calling from across the wheel?

The mandala becomes legible. Not as 64 memorised symbols, but as a living structure you can read from any angle.

## What's Next

We've learned the vocabulary. Binary. Bigram. Trigram. Three lenses, each with its own oppositions woven through.

But how do the eight trigram states relate to each other? Is there an order? A cycle? Does Thunder follow Wind? Does Earth become Mountain?

Next we trace the electromagnetic cycle itself — how energy accumulates, peaks, discharges, and grounds. The wheel isn't just breathing. It's circulating.
