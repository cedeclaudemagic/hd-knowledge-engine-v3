# The Wheel Series

*Exploring the mathematical structure of the Rave Mandala*

*Status: In Development — not yet published*

## The Arc

This series examines the I Ching wheel's mathematical structure — what the binary patterns reveal about nested frequencies, trigram states, and the electromagnetic cycle that underlies the mandala.

Unlike the [Electromagnetic Consciousness Series](../electromagnetic-consciousness-series/), which focuses on individual and transpersonal Human Design mechanics, this series stays with the wheel itself: its architecture, its cycles, its built-in chemistry.

## Articles

### 1. [The Breathing Wheel](./01-breathing-wheel.md)
*Nested Frequencies and the Hub-Rim Structure*

The discovery: each of the six lines oscillates at a different rate around the wheel. Line 1 changes twice. Line 6 changes sixty-two times. A gradient from stable hub to volatile rim.

**Key concepts:** Nested oscillations, hub/rim structure, the four quadrants

---

### 2. [The Three Readings](./02-three-readings.md)
*Binary, Bigram, and Trigram as Lenses*

Three ways to read any hexagram: the single binary (yang/yin), the bigram pairs (four combinations, mapping to Quarters), and the trigrams (eight states). Each reveals different dimensions of the same position.

**Key concepts:** Binary polarity, bigram domains, trigram states, oppositions across the wheel

### 3. [The Electromagnetic Cycle](./03-electromagnetic-cycle.md)
*Eight Trigram States as Phases of Accumulation and Expression*

The eight trigrams form a cycle: Earth → Mountain → Water → Wind → Heaven (accumulation) and Heaven → Lake → Fire → Thunder → Earth (expression). The wheel maps a complete electromagnetic oscillation.

**Key concepts:** Accumulation vs expression arcs, Heaven as seed, Earth as manifestation, the inversion of conventional understanding

### 4. The Chemistry of Form *(planned)*
*Aromatic Amino Acid Distribution and the Seed/Manifestation Inversion*

The aromatic amino acids — those with delocalised electron rings — cluster heavily at Earth and Mountain trigrams. Statistical validation (χ² = 9.57, p < 0.05). Why does chemistry confirm the electromagnetic model?

**Key concepts:** Aromatic amino acids, cation-π interactions, biochemical validation, the 2-14 channel as diode junction

## Connection to Electromagnetic Consciousness Series

Article 3 of both series covers overlapping territory — the trigram cycle. This is the bridge point:

- **EM Consciousness Article 3** (The Vortex and the Wave) introduces transpersonal forms and their unidirectional nature
- **Wheel Series Article 3** (The Electromagnetic Cycle) details the eight trigram states and their phase relationships

The Penta mechanics explored in EM Consciousness Article 5 (Inside the Vortex) build directly on the trigram framework established in the Wheel Series.

## Reading Order

For newcomers to the Wheel structure: Read 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

If you've already read the EM Consciousness Series: Start with Article 3 to see the trigram foundation, then work backward.
