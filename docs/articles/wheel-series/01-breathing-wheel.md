# The Breathing Wheel

*First in a series exploring the mathematical structure of the Rave Mandala*

*Status: DRAFT — not yet published*

There's something the mandala wants to show us.

Not the gates. Not the channels. Not the centres or the types or any of the layers we've learned to read. Something underneath all of that. Something in the structure itself.

The wheel breathes.

## The Question Nobody Asks

We learn to read the Rave Wheel gate by gate. We memorise the sequence: 41 at the start, winding around through 64 positions, each with its hexagram, its name, its meaning.

But what makes a hexagram? Six lines. Six positions. Each either yang (solid) or yin (broken).

And here's the question: as we move around the wheel, how often does each line actually change?

I expected some variation. I didn't expect this.

## What the Data Shows

Line 6 — the top line — changes **62 times** as you move around the wheel. Almost every single gate.

Line 1 — the bottom line — changes **twice**. Just twice. In the entire 64-gate sequence.

Let that land.

The top of the hexagram flickers constantly. The bottom barely moves.

Here's the full picture:

| Line | Changes |
|------|---------|
| Line 6 (top) | 62 |
| Line 5 | 30 |
| Line 4 | 14 |
| Line 3 | 6 |
| Line 2 | 2 |
| Line 1 (bottom) | 2 |

This is a gradient. A spectrum. A nested set of frequencies, each oscillating at its own rate.

## The Hub and the Rim

Think about an actual wheel. A cartwheel, a bicycle wheel, a prayer wheel spinning.

The hub barely moves. It's the centre, the stable point around which everything else turns.

The rim spins fastest. Maximum velocity. Maximum change.

The Rave Wheel is built the same way.

Line 1 is the hub. It divides the wheel into two great hemispheres — yang for one half, yin for the other. That's it. Two changes. Maximum stability.

Line 6 is the rim. It alternates almost every gate — yang, yin, yang, yin — spinning at the outer edge of the structure.

And the lines in between? They're the spokes. Each oscillating at its own rate, connecting the stillness of the hub to the motion of the rim.

## The Visual Pattern

If you trace each line around the wheel (starting at Gate 41), here's what you see:

```
Line 1: 1111111111111111110000000000000000000000000000000011111111111111
Line 2: 1100000000000000000000000000000000111111111111111111111111111111
Line 3: 0011111111000000000000000011111111000000001111111111111111000000
Line 4: 0011110000111100000000111100001111000011110000111111110000111100
Line 5: 0011001100110011000011001100110011001100110011001111001100110011
Line 6: 1010101010101010100101010101010101010101010101010110101010101010
```

Each 1 is yang. Each 0 is yin.

Look at Line 1. Long stretches of 1s, then long stretches of 0s. Slow. Stable. The fundamental tone.

Look at Line 6. Rapid alternation. 1010101010. The highest harmonic. The trembling surface.

This isn't random. This is structure.

## The Four Quadrants

Lines 1 and 2 both change only twice — but not at the same places.

Line 1 shifts:
- Gate 24 → Gate 2 (yang to yin)
- Gate 44 → Gate 1 (yin to yang)

Line 2 shifts:
- Gate 19 → Gate 13 (yang to yin)  
- Gate 33 → Gate 7 (yin to yang)

When you combine two lines that each divide the wheel in half, but at different points, you get four quadrants.

The two most stable lines — the deepest foundation of the hexagram — create the four fundamental divisions of the wheel.

This is not coincidence. This is architecture.

---

## Nested Frequencies

What we're looking at is a system of nested oscillations.

The bottom lines oscillate slowly — long wavelengths, bass notes, the stable ground.

The top lines oscillate rapidly — short wavelengths, treble notes, the shimmering surface.

Every hexagram, every gate position, is defined by *where you are in all six oscillations simultaneously*.

It's like standing at a point in the ocean and asking: what's the state of every wave passing through here, from the deep slow swells to the tiny surface ripples?

The hexagram is the answer. Six lines. Six frequencies. One position.

---

## The Wheel Breathes

This changes how I see the mandala.

Not 64 separate symbols arranged in a circle. But a single breathing structure, with stable depths and volatile surfaces, with slow rhythms underneath rapid flickers.

The foundation holds. The expression changes.

Line 1 provides the ground — the hemisphere you're standing in.

Line 6 provides the variation — the specific flavour of this moment.

And the lines between connect them, each mediating between stillness and motion at its own pace.

## What This Opens

I'm not going to pretend I know what all of this means yet. But I know it's real. It's in the mathematics. It's in the structure Ra gave us.

There are questions now:

Why this particular pattern? What does it mean that the foundation is stable while the surface flickers?

How does this relate to the trigrams — those three-line structures that give each hexagram its character?

What happens when we layer the electromagnetic principles we've been exploring onto this breathing architecture?

These are questions for future articles. For now, I want to sit with the image itself.

The wheel breathes. The hub holds still. The rim spins. And every position is a chord — six notes sounding together, each at its own frequency.

Listen.
