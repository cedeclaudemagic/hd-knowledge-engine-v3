# The Electromagnetic Cycle

*Third in a series exploring the mathematical structure of the Rave Mandala*

*Status: DRAFT — not yet published*

---

We have the vocabulary now. Binary, bigram, trigram. Three ways of reading the same structure.

But the eight trigram states aren't just categories. They're not filing cabinets for sorting hexagrams. They're *phases* — moments in a cycle. And the cycle is always moving.

Energy doesn't sit still. It accumulates. It peaks. It discharges. It grounds. And then it begins again.

This is that cycle.

---

## Two Movements

The cycle has two great arcs:

**Accumulation:** Earth → Mountain → Water → Wind → Heaven

Energy gathers. Charge builds. Potential increases. Until it peaks.

**Expression:** Heaven → Lake → Fire → Thunder → Earth

Energy releases. Charge flows. Potential actualises. Until it grounds.

Then the cycle begins again.

This isn't metaphor. This is how electromagnetic systems actually work. Capacitors charge and discharge. Current flows from high potential to low. Lightning arcs from cloud to ground.

The I Ching mapped this thousands of years ago. The wheel holds it still.

## The Rising Arc

### Earth (000)

We begin at ground. Pure yin. All lines broken, all spaces open.

This is stability. Reception. The field at rest. Nothing moving, nothing needing to move.

But rest isn't emptiness. Earth has received everything that discharged before. The ground holds what was given. Form persists here.

In electromagnetic terms: this is ground potential. Zero voltage relative to itself. The reference point from which all charge is measured.

---

### Mountain (001)

The first yang line appears at the top. Something stirs above the stillness.

Mountain is containment. Storage. Yin foundation with a yang cap — energy held, sealed in. Potential accumulating in a closed system.

Think of a capacitor beginning to charge. Or a battery at rest. The charge is there, but contained beneath the surface. Waiting.

In the body, this is where reserves build. Resources gather. Strength accumulates before it's needed.

---

### Water (010)

Now the yang is in the middle — Line 2. Flowing between yin banks.

Water is current. Movement. The path of least resistance. Energy is no longer stored; it's travelling.

But Water doesn't radiate. It doesn't broadcast. It finds channels and moves through them. Hidden flow. Underground rivers. The circulation that happens beneath the surface.

This is the current in a wire. Not the spark, not the light — just the steady movement of charge from one place to another.

---

### Wind (011)

Yang in Lines 2 and 3, building upward from a yin foundation.

Wind is accumulation in motion. Persistent. Gradual. The pressure that doesn't stop.

Unlike Water, which finds existing channels, Wind creates pressure. It builds and builds. Not dramatic, not sudden — just relentless.

This is the inductance phase. Energy storing in a magnetic field. The coil that builds charge through sustained input. Not explosive, but powerful in its patience.

---

### Heaven (111)

All yang. Every line solid. Maximum charge.

Heaven is the peak. The crisis point. There's nowhere left to accumulate. The system is full.

This is what we usually think of as "potential" — but it's not the seed, it's the moment just before lightning. Loaded. Unstable. The instant before discharge becomes inevitable.

In plasma physics, this is ionisation. Matter so charged it becomes a new state entirely. Stars are made of this. The sun is Heaven burning.

Heaven doesn't want to stay Heaven. It *must* express. The charge demands ground.

---

## The Turning Point

Here's what shifts everything:

We usually think of seeds as small, potential, waiting to grow. And manifestation as the big result, the achievement.

But look at what's actually happening:

**Heaven is the seed.** Maximum charge. Fully loaded. Everything accumulated, compressed, ready. The seed contains the entire tree — not as empty potential but as concentrated actuality. It *must* express. It cannot hold.

**Earth is the manifestation.** Where form actually crystallises and persists. The ground that receives the discharge and shapes it into structure. Stable. Enduring.

The seed isn't the beginning — it's the peak of accumulation. The crisis point where expression becomes inevitable.

Manifestation isn't the end — it's where form finally holds still long enough to *be* something.

This reframes everything.

---

## The Falling Arc

### Lake (110)

Yang at the bottom and middle, with yin opening at the top. The surface breaks.

Lake is the mouth. The opening through which accumulated charge begins to release. The dam that cracks. The valve that opens.

This is capacitive discharge beginning. The gap that allows current to arc. Not the full release yet — just the opening that makes release possible.

Lake is associated with joy, with expression, with the mouth that speaks. Of course it is. This is where what's been contained finally gets to come out.

---

### Fire (101)

Yang at top and bottom. Yin in the middle.

Fire is sustained oscillation. Not a single spark but a continuous glow. The discharge that doesn't just flash and vanish but holds itself in radiance.

This is light. Electromagnetic radiation. The wave that propagates outward, carrying energy through space.

Fire holds emptiness at its centre — that middle yin. It radiates around a void. This is why fire illuminates but doesn't fill. It reveals what's there without adding to it.

---

### Thunder (100)

Yang only at the bottom. The single spark.

Thunder is the discharge. The lightning strike. The moment of release.

All that accumulated charge, finding its path to ground. Sudden. Dramatic. Unmistakable.

This is the circuit completing. The arc that bridges the gap. The impulse that clears the system.

After Thunder, the charge is spent. The tension resolves. What was loaded is now released.

---

### Earth (000)

And we return. Ground receives what was discharged. Form crystallises from the released energy. Stability returns.

But Earth isn't empty now. It holds what Thunder delivered. The cycle isn't a circle that returns to nothing — it's a spiral. Each pass deposits something. Form accumulates across cycles.

The ground is richer than it was.

---

## The Complete Cycle

Now we can see it whole:

```
        ACCUMULATION                    EXPRESSION
        
Earth ──→ Mountain ──→ Water ──→ Wind ──→ Heaven
  ↑                                         │
  │                                         ↓
  └──── Thunder ←── Fire ←── Lake ←─────────┘
```

Or in electromagnetic terms:

```
Ground → Storage → Current → Inductance → Plasma
   ↑                                        │
   │                                        ↓
   └─── Discharge ← Radiation ← Capacitance ┘
```

The wheel holds this. Every hexagram sits somewhere in this cycle — its lower trigram indicating one phase, its upper trigram indicating another. Internal complexity. Multiple positions in the cycle held simultaneously.

---

## Why This Matters

This isn't just pretty structure. It's operational.

When you know where you are in the cycle, you know what's coming. You know what's needed.

In an accumulation phase, pushing for discharge is premature. The system isn't ready. Wind needs to keep building.

In a discharge phase, trying to accumulate is futile. The energy is flowing out. Let Thunder complete.

The hexagram tells you where you are. The cycle tells you where that leads.

---

## What's Next

We've traced the cycle. Accumulation to peak to expression to ground.

But there's something we haven't explained yet. When we look at the actual chemistry — the amino acids encoded at each gate — something strange appears.

The aromatic amino acids, those special molecules with their ring structures and delocalised electrons, cluster almost entirely at Earth and Mountain. The stable phases. The ground states.

Why?

Next we look at the chemistry of form — what the molecular structure tells us about why Earth is the foundation, not the destination.
