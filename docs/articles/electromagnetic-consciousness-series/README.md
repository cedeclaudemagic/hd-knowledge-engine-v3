## The Arc

This series moves from individual consciousness architecture outward to the transpersonal forms that emerge when humans gather.

**Individual Architecture (Articles 1-2, 4)**
How your personal consciousness operates as an electromagnetic system—the transformer at your core, the circuit diagram of your bodygraph, the nine centres as resonant cavities.

**Transpersonal Forms (Articles 3, 5)**
What happens when individual fields overlap—the violent extraction of the Penta vortex, the standing waves of the Wa, and the detailed circuit mechanics of how groups actually function.

### 1. [The Transformer at the Heart of Being](./01-transformer-at-heart-of-being.md)
*Why Consciousness Requires AC, Not DC*

The Magnetic Monopole as transformer core. The 88-degree offset between Design and Personality crystals. Why consciousness must alternate rather than fix. The violence that starts the oscillation.

**Key concepts:** AC vs DC consciousness, transformer coupling, the 2-degree wobble

### 4. [The Nine Resonators](./04-nine-resonators.md)
*Consciousness as Quantum-to-Classical Electromagnetic Architecture*

Each centre as a resonator on the quantum-to-classical spectrum. Head and Root as pressure sources. The three awareness centres at different frequencies. Motors and their characteristics. The Throat as output transformer.

**Key concepts:** Resonant frequency, quantum superposition, wave function collapse, the complete spectrum

### 5. [Inside the Vortex](./05-inside-the-vortex.md) *(draft)*
*The Penta as Electromagnetic Circuit*

The detailed circuit mechanics of the Penta. Each of the nine gates mapped to specific electromagnetic components: inductance, capacitance, voltage regulation, amplification, feedback and feedforward control. Line harmonics in transpersonal forms.

**Key concepts:** The 9 Penta gates as circuit components, line harmonics (1↔4, 2↔5, 3↔6), the diode nature

## Reading Order

For newcomers: Read in order 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

For those interested in group dynamics specifically: 1 → 3 → 5

For individual chart reading focus: 1 → 2 → 4
